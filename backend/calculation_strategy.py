🎯 DATABASE CALCULATIONS STRATEGY FOR ZUS COFFEE CHATBOT
========================================================

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ You have basic pricing fields in database
✅ Products are already loaded with price data
✅ PostgreSQL supports JSON and computed columns

RECOMMENDATION: SELECTIVE PRE-CALCULATION
==========================================

1. 📊 STORE IN DATABASE (Pre-calculate):
   ▶️ Discount percentages (30% off, etc.)
   ▶️ Savings amount (RM 24.00 saved)
   ▶️ Tax-inclusive pricing
   ▶️ Bundle/promotional pricing
   ▶️ Featured product flags

2. ⚡ CALCULATE ON-THE-FLY (Real-time):
   ▶️ Cart totals
   ▶️ Shipping costs
   ▶️ Promo code discounts
   ▶️ Final checkout amounts

WHY THIS APPROACH?
==================
✅ Performance: Pre-calculated values load faster
✅ Consistency: Pricing displayed consistently
✅ Flexibility: Real-time calculations for dynamic data
✅ Simple: Minimal changes to your current structure

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR YOUR PROJECT:
===================================

1. ADD THESE COLUMNS TO YOUR PRODUCT TABLE:
   - discount_percentage (FLOAT)
   - discount_amount (FLOAT) 
   - is_on_sale (BOOLEAN)
   - savings_display (VARCHAR) -- "Save RM 24.00"

2. CREATE A CART CALCULATION SERVICE:
   - Handle real-time cart totals
   - Apply promo codes
   - Calculate shipping

3. UPDATE YOUR CURRENT DATA:
   - Calculate discounts for existing products
   - Add savings display text
   - Mark sale items

EXAMPLE FOR YOUR CURRENT PRODUCTS:
==================================

# Example calculation for your current products
sample_calculations = [
    {
        "product": "ZUS OG CUP 2.0",
        "current_price": "RM 55.00",
        "regular_price": "RM 79.00", 
        "calculated_discount": 30.4,
        "calculated_savings": "RM 24.00",
        "display_savings": "Save RM 24.00 (30% off)"

        "current_price": "RM 41.30", 
        "regular_price": "RM 59.00",
        "calculated_discount": 30.0,
        "calculated_savings": "RM 17.70",
        "display_savings": "Save RM 17.70 (30% off)"
    }

Price: {calc['current_price']} (was {calc['regular_price']})

FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR CHATBOT:
======================================

For a CHATBOT specifically, focus on:

1. 🤖 FAST PRODUCT QUERIES:
   - Pre-calculate all pricing displays
   - Store "savings" text for chat responses
   - Index on sale/featured flags

   - "This ZUS OG Cup is on sale! Save RM 24.00 (30% off)"
   - "Regular price RM 79.00, now only RM 55.00"
   - "Limited time offer - Buy 1 Free 1"

3. ⚡ REAL-TIME CART:
   - When user adds to cart, calculate total on-the-fly
   - Apply promo codes dynamically
   - Show tax breakdown
