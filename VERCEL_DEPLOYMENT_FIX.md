# Vercel Deployment Fix - Updated Suggestions

## Issue
Vercel was showing old frontend suggestions instead of the updated practical, data-driven prompts.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Version Bump
- Updated `package.json` version from `2.0.0` â†’ `2.1.0`
- Added timestamp comment in `SuggestedPrompts.tsx` (Updated 2025-07-08)

### 2. Vercel Configuration
- Added `frontend/vercel.json` with proper build configuration
- Configured Next.js build settings for optimal deployment

### 3. Cache Busting
- Forced commit with version changes to trigger fresh deployment
- Pushed changes to master branch to trigger automatic Vercel rebuild

## How to Verify the Fix

### Check Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Look for new deployment with commit `096dc26`
3. Wait for "Ready" status (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Verify Frontend:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Check if suggested prompts now show:
   - "Show me ZUS OG Cup 2.0 with screw-on lid"
   - "What's the cheapest ceramic mug available?"
   - "Find ZUS Coffee outlets in Kuala Lumpur"
   - "Calculate 6% SST on RM55"

### If Still Showing Old Prompts:
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache** for your Vercel domain
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for global CDN to update

## Expected Timeline
- **Immediate**: Git push completed âœ…
- **2-3 minutes**: Vercel build completes
- **5-10 minutes**: CDN cache refresh globally
- **Result**: New practical suggestions visible

## What Changed in Suggestions
The new suggestions are now:
- âœ… **Data-driven** (real ZUS products and prices)
- âœ… **Practical** (actual customer scenarios)
- âœ… **Validated** (work with chatbot capabilities)

vs. old generic suggestions that weren't useful.
